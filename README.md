This is a web app to assist with playing a game of Sentinels of the Multiverse.

Please see below for a more in depth description of the what the app is.

## Development Setup


## Explanation

There are three major components:
* A screen display for the villain and an overview for all players.
* An iPad sized interface for the villain controls.
* A mobile phone sized interface for each of the heroes.


## Large Screen Display Game Overview
* Current Hero with HP
* Small Listing of each hero and their HP
* Somehow highlight the highest and lowest HP hero.

This component should not be required in order to play the game. This is an optional accessory if you happen to be playing in a room with a large screen tv. It should only provide read only information. We may actually be able to accomplish this with dashing but I'm not sure that is the best idea.

## Villian Interface
* Current Villian Name and HP
* Interface for adding arbitrary minions and their current HP.
* Interface for modifying the HP for the villain.
* Interface for adding arbitrary modifiers to both the villian to the minions.


## Hero Interface
* Current hero name and HP
* Ability to modify HP easily.
* Ability to add modifiers easily and see all current modifiers.
